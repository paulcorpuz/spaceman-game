üìù Description
============
Project one is a game of Space Man, based on the popular children's game. In this version of the game, the player is attempting to guess the hidden word selected at random by the CPU.
1. Using the on-screen keyboard, the player will guess a letter of the word.
2. If a guessed letter is in the word, it's revealed in its correct position.
3. Incorrect guesses result in losing a guess attempt.
4. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of guess attempts.
